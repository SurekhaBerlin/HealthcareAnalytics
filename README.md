## PATIENT EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT DASHBOARD
Have you ever rushed to an emergency room, only to encounter a long wait for treatment? To shed light on this common experience, I created a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics from emergency department patient admissions data.

### Key Findings:
1. Patient Satisfaction: The majority of patients reported being less than moderately satisfied with their experience.
2, Average Wait Time: The average wait time before being seen was 35.26 minutes.
3. Peak and Off-Peak Wait Times: Wait times peaked on Mondays at 11 PM and were shortest on Wednesdays at 1 AM.
4. Referral Trends: The most frequent referral from the ER was to General Practice, followed by Orthopedics.
   
### The Data
### Dataset Source: 

This dataset comes from Real World Fake Data, representing a simulated hospital ER.

### Entries: 
There are 9,216 entries, each corresponding to a patient.
### Attributes:
The dataset includes 11 attributes, such as patient ID, gender, race, and wait time.
### The Dashboard
### Access:
The interactive dashboard is available for viewing on Power BI.
### Poor Satisfaction
### Satisfaction Score: 
The average satisfaction score among patients was just 4.99 out of 10.
### Score Breakdown: 
On a 0-10 scale, where 0-6 are detractors, 7-8 are passive, and 9-10 are promoters, most patients had a negative experience.
### Highest and Lowest Scores: 
The highest satisfaction score was in March (5.327), and the lowest was in April (4.627).
### Need for Improvement: 
Changes are necessary to improve the patient experience, possibly due to overcrowding or inadequate staffing.
Average Wait Times
### Monthly Variation: 
Monthly averages for wait times showed minimal variation.
### Highest and Lowest Averages: 
The highest average was 36.67 minutes in February, and the lowest was 34.27 minutes in September.
Longest and Shortest Wait Times
### Heat Map Analysis:
The longest waits occurred on Monday nights at 11 PM, averaging 40.69 minutes, while the shortest waits were on Wednesdays at 1 AM, averaging 29.65 minutes.
Surprising Trends: Peak wait times did not occur on Fridays or weekends. Weekday dinner times generally had shorter waits, except on Tuesdays at 6 PM and Friday nights. Sundays typically had shorter waits than Saturdays.
### Department Referrals
### Primary Referrals: 
General Practice tops the list of ER referrals for conditions like the flu, chest pain, dehydration, and allergic reactions.
### Access Issues: 
Many individuals lack access to a primary care physician due to insurance or socioeconomic barriers, making the ER their only option.
Second Most Common Referral: Orthopedics is the second most common referral, addressing issues like broken bones and sports injuries.
### Takeaways
### Patient Perception: 
A patientâ€™s view of the healthcare system is often shaped by their experiences in hospitals and clinics.
### Low Satisfaction Impact: 
An emergency room with a low satisfaction score, such as 4.99 out of 10, typically results in dissatisfied patients.
Factors Contributing to Low Scores: Lengthy wait times contribute to this low score; patients waited an average of 35.25 minutes before treatment and were often referred to general practitioners.
Importance of Metrics: Understanding these metrics helps patients make informed decisions about where to seek care and aids hospital leadership in implementing necessary improvements.


## Thanks for Reading! I look forward to conducting more real-time analyses of healthcare data to promote data-driven decision-making. If this interests you, follow along for more updates!
