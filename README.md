# PATIENT EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT DASHBOARD

Have you ever rushed to an emergency room, only to encounter a long wait for treatment? To shed light on this common experience, I created a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics from emergency department patient admissions data. This dashboard provides insights into average wait times, patient satisfaction, and referral trends, helping both patients and healthcare providers better understand the dynamics of emergency care. Through this analysis, we can identify areas for improvement and enhance the overall patient experience in the ER.

### Key Findings:

* The majority of patients reported being less than moderately satisfied with their experience.
* The average wait time before being seen was 35.26 minutes.
* Wait times peaked on Mondays at 11 PM and were shortest on Wednesdays at 1 AM.
* The most frequent referral from the ER was to General Practice, followed by Orthopedics.

The Data This dataset comes from Real World Fake Data, representing a simulated hospital ER with 9,216 entries, each corresponding to a patient, and encompassing 11 attributes, such as patient ID, gender, race, and wait time.
The Dashboard The interactive dashboard is available for viewing on Power BI.

Poor Satisfaction As highlighted in the top right corner of the dashboard, the average satisfaction score among patients in this emergency department was just 4.99 out of 10. Breaking it down on a 0-10 scale—where 0-6 are detractors, 7-8 are passive, and 9-10 are promoters—it’s clear that most patients had a negative experience. The highest satisfaction score recorded was in March at 5.327, while the lowest was in April at 4.627. Whether due to overcrowding or inadequate staffing, changes are necessary to improve the patient’s experience.
Average Wait Times Monthly averages for wait times showed minimal variation. The highest average was 36.67 minutes in February, and the lowest was 34.27 minutes in September, with an overall average of 35.26 minutes.

Longest and Shortest Wait Times Analyzing the heat map detailing wait times by hour and day revealed both similarities and notable differences. The longest waits occurred on Monday nights at 11 PM, averaging 40.69 minutes, while the shortest waits were on Wednesdays at 1 AM, averaging 29.65 minutes. It was surprising that peak wait times didn’t occur on Fridays or weekends. Weekday dinner times generally showed shorter waits, with exceptions on Tuesdays at 6 PM and Friday nights, while Sundays tended to have shorter waits than Saturdays.
Department Referrals General Practice tops the list of ER referrals, often due to conditions like the flu, chest pain, dehydration, or allergic reactions. This broad category includes various issues that could often be addressed by a primary care physician. However, many individuals lack access to a PCP because of insurance or socioeconomic barriers, making the ER their only option. Orthopedics is the second most common referral, addressing broken bones, severe fractures, dislocations, and sports injuries.

### Takeaways 
A patient’s view of the healthcare system is frequently shaped by their experiences in hospitals, urgent care, doctors’ offices, or pharmacies. An emergency room with a low satisfaction score, such as 4.99 out of 10, typically results in dissatisfied patients. Factors contributing to this low score may include lengthy wait times; in this case, patients waited an average of 35.25 minutes before receiving treatment and were most often referred to general practitioners.

Understanding these metrics can help patients make informed decisions about where to seek care and assist hospital leadership in implementing necessary improvements. The data clearly indicates that changes are essential to enhance patient care in this ER.
Thanks for Reading! I look forward to conducting more real-time analyses of healthcare data to promote data-driven decision-making. If this is an area of interest for you, follow along for more updates!
